# ♾️ DevOps & Site Reliability Engineering
> Part of the [Naval Thakur Portfolio](../README.md)

DevOps is more than just pipelines; it's the cultural and technical foundation for modern software delivery.

## 🏗️ Core Pillars
- **CI/CD:** Automated builds, tests, and deployments to reduce the "fear of release."
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Managing infrastructure via Git (Terraform, Ansible, Pulumi).
- **Observability:** Moving beyond monitoring to Logging, Metrics, and Tracing (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK).
- **SRE:** Applying software engineering to operations (SLIs, SLOs, Error Budgets).

## 📊 Maturity Model
1. **Initial:** Manual, siloed, frequent fires.
2. **Managed:** Project-based automation, tracking basic metrics.
3. **Defined:** Org-wide standards, proactive monitoring.
4. **Measured:** DevSecOps integration, data-driven improvements.
5. **Optimized:** Self-healing systems, Chaos Engineering.

## 🛠️ Tool-stack
- **VCS:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes, Helm, OpenShift.
- **Automation:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD.
