# 🤖 GenAI & LLMOps

Operationalizing Artificial Intelligence for the modern enterprise.

## 🧠 Fundamentals
- **Tokens:** The basic units of model computation.
- **Context Window:** The "short-term memory" of the model.
- **Temperature:** Controlling deterministic vs. creative outputs.

## 🚀 RAG Architecture
*Retrieval-Augmented Generation*
- **Ingestion:** Loading organizational data.
- **Embedding:** Converting text to vectors.
- **Retrieval:** Finding relevant context for user queries.
- **Generation:** Augmenting the prompt with retrieved facts to eliminate hallucinations.

## 🛡️ AI Governance
- **Prompt Injection:** Protecting against malicious instructions.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensuring sensitive data doesn't leak into public training sets.
- **LLMOps:** The CI/CD of model deployments and evaluation.
